## What's up ðŸ‘‹

### Who:
Bryan Oliveira (He/Him)
Caltech Computer Science Undergrad ('26)

### What:
I'm currently strengthening my full-stack development skills and trying to work on building apps from the ground-up.

I love everything to do with computers, and have since I was a kid, so I've really enjoyed learning low-level systems programming and hope to develop those skills as well over time.

Currently my most fleshed out project is [Liveable](https://liveable-zeta.vercel.app/), a Next.js house affordability platform that lets you search through job postings in different states and find out how "liveable" it would be based on the house price and the job's salary range.

### How:
You can find out more about me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-r-oliveira/) or my [Portfolio Site](https://bryoliveira.github.io/).
